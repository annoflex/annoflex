        <h1>List of Examples</h1>
        <h2>Tutorial Scanners</h2>
        <p>AnnoFlex provides for beginners a simple and short tutorial consisting of three parts each in the
        form of a scanner. Part one starts with a minimal scanner definition which shows how a scanner
        definition is structured in principle. Part two is based on part one and additionally contains the
        generated code of the scanner. Part three shows how this code can be customized.</p>
        <p>You can use the following links to open the tutorial files:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="TutorialPart1.java">TutorialPart1.java</a></li>
            <li><a href="TutorialPart2.java">TutorialPart2.java</a></li>
            <li><a href="TutorialPart3.java">TutorialPart3.java</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Scanners used by AnnoFlex</h2>
        <p>AnnoFlex uses its own parsers for Java source code files and regular expressions. The scanners of
        both parsers are written with AnnoFlex and thus well-suited for the use as examples. As both scanners
        have dependencies to other classes they are not available as a single source code file in
        this examples directory. Instead they are referenced via a link into the source code directory of the
        AnnoFlex installation package.</p>
        <p>If you want to investigate these scanners, it is recommended to use the entire source code of
        AnnoFlex instead of the single scanner files. To do this create a new project in your favorite IDE and
        copy the entire content of the <code>source</code> folder into this project and add this folder as a
        source folder. As the code itself does not have any dependencies to other libraries this can be
        performed within a few minutes.</p>
        <h3>Java Source Code Scanner</h3>
        <p>The <code>JavaScanner</code> is used by AnnoFlex to scan Java source code files. It is a very
        simple scanner which mainly consists of lexical rules for keywords and special symbols. Only comments
        and literals step out of line and are more difficult to understand.</p>

        <h3>Regular Expression Scanner</h3>
        <p>The <code>RegExScanner</code> is used by AnnoFlex to scan regular expressions. This scanner makes
        use of lexical states and state stacks. So it is a good reference if you want to investigate how this
        technique works.</p>
